# Hybrid Autoencoder-Random Forest Approach for Cancer Subtype Classification from RNA-Seq Data

## Problem Statement
Cancer is a heterogeneous disease with several subtypes, each associated with a distinct gene expression profile. Subtype classification is essential for guiding personalized treatment. RNA-Seq is a powerful tool to measure overall gene expression changes across the whole transcriptome, making it a valuable source of information for subtype classification. However, its high dimensionality poses a challenge to building computationally efficient classification frameworks, prompting current approaches to focus on few biomarkers which might be insufficient for capturing the complex molecular differences between cancer subtypes.
